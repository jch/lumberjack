<h4>Ruby on Rails</h4>
<p>
  As a Rails developer, it's likely that you spend many hours staring
  at your development log scroll by in a terminal.  For something you
  spend so much time with, isn't it time to rethink what's possible?
</p>
<p>
  Lumberjack is Rails 2 and 3 compatible. With customization and themes,
  other popular Rack frameworks are easily adaptable as well.
</p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p><!-- paintbrush/css icon -->
  Logger separates each request into it's own easy-to-read timestamped
  section. It's easy to highlight a section so you don't lose your
  place. Logger also hides common log noise, but still lets you see
  them when you need it.
</p>

<h4>Sharing</h4>
<p><!-- gist icon, or sharing arrow icon -->
  When you get stuck on a problem, it's tricky to highlight what you
  need to ask your team for help. With Lumberjack's [gist]() support, it's
  a snap to copy and show your team the problem.
</p>

<h4>Search and Highlight</h4>
<p><!-- magnifying glass -->
  No more squinting to look for that line mixed in with all that SQL
  gobbledgook. Use the same beautiful and intuitive search Cocoa gives
  you.
</p>

<h4>Open in Editor</h4>
<p><!-- textmate, macvim, emacs stacked icon, or xcode, or textmate -->
  Hit an exception? Just click on the line, and have it open in your
  preferred editor.
</p>

<h4>Keyboard shortcuts</h4>
<p>
  Real lumberjacks don't use mice.  With familiar keyboard shortcuts, you'll
  blaze through all of Lumberjack's features without ever touching no stinkin'
  mouse.
