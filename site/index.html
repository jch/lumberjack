  Lumberjack Logger
</p>

<p>
  - the smarter way to view your Rails log files on the Mac.
</p>

<p>
  As a Rails developer, it's likely that you spend many hours staring
  at your development log scroll by in a terminal.  For something you
  spend so much time with, isn't it time to rethink what's possible?
</p>

<h4>Clearly Formatted</h4>
<p>
  Logger separates each request into it's own easy-to-read timestamped
  section. It's easy to highlight a section so you don't lose your
  place. Logger also hides common log noise, but still lets you see
  them when you need it.
</p>

<h4>Sharing</h4>
<p>
  When you get stuck on a problem, it's tricky to highlight what you
  need to ask your team for help. With Logger's [gist]() support, it's
  a snap to copy and show your team the problem.
</p>

<h4>Search and Highlight</h4>
<p>
  No more squinting to look for that line mixed in with all that SQL
  gobbledgook. Use the same beautiful and intuitive search Cocoa gives
  you.
</p>

<h4>Open in Editor</h4>
<p>
  Hit an exception? Just click on the line, and have it open in your
  preferred editor.
</p>

<h4>Programmer Friendly</h4>
